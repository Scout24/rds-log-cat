# rds-log-cat [UNMAINTAINED]

Shipping RDS logs from s3 into a kinesis stream.
For example: This enables you to stream your logs into a elastic search cluster with kibana. Or any other logging/monitoring solutions.
The repo is not maintained any more, because there is no use for it from our side.

How this works
==============

rds-log-cat is a lambda function which can be triggered by a S3 bucket (on new files e.g.). It parses the logfiles and post it to kinesis.


How to install
==============

If you are in the vertical ImmobilienScout, the simplest and most automated method is to use teamcity.

You can put your copy of rds-log-cat to [our project](https://teamcity.rz.is/admin/editProject.html?projectId=Infrastructure_Aws_RdsLoggingStacks_BDeployToAccounts) or in your own project.
Please use this [rds-log-template](
https://teamcity.rz.is/admin/editBuildParams.html?id=template:Infrastructure_Aws_RdsLoggingStacks_AwsRdsLogCatFullCiCdSingleAccount)


To build and test locally, simply execute:
   
    pyb
   
To build and deploy to AWS:
First configure the location, where to put the artifacts (lamdba and cloudformation stack) to:

    DISTRIBUTION_BUCKET_PREFIX=rds-log-cat

The AWS_DEFAULT_REGION will be added to the DISTRIBUTION_BUCKET_PREFIX like: rds-log-cat-eu-west-1

Build and deploy with the "teamcity" profile:
    
    pyb -o -E teamcity
   
At the end you will see, where the lambda is deployed to.
Now you can test the function in AWS with:

   ./run_integration_tests.py

If this succeeded you can deploy the cloudformation stack (see deployed artifacts).
Configuration is made in the description section of the function.

* kinesisStream - kinesis stream to post to
* type - type of logfile can be: postgresql or mysql

Example stacks can be found in [cfn/](tree/master/cfn/). See [README](tree/master/cfn/README.md) for how to deploy the stacks.

You can write your own parser to parse your logfiles (see below). 

How to use my own parser
========================

Create a python class with the name of your choice in
[parser/](tree/master/src/main/python/rds_log_cat/parser)

The class must implement at least the parse method from [Parser](tree/master/src/main/python/rds_log_cat/parser/parser)

Roll out the lambda with the config: type pointing to the name (without .py) of your created file.
